# Exercise: Exploring Census Data with Tidyverse Tools

We will duplicate some of the analyses in [AUSCD 3 Wrangling Census data with tidyverse tools](https://walker-data.com/census-r/wrangling-census-data-with-tidyverse-tools.html). First, read 3.1 The tidyverse.

1. Referring to 3.2.1 Sorting and filtering data, write R code to show all the counties in your state with a median age of 50 or higher. Refer to 2.2.1 to remind yourself how to request counties in a single state. Then write R code to show the median age for all places in your state ordered by median age.  (Remember, "place" is an allowable Census geography with a specific meaning.)
2. Referring to 3.2.2 Using summary variables and calculating new columns, write R code to show all the counties in your state and the percent of the population by race in each county.
