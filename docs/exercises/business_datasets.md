# Exercise 6: Shift-Share Analysis

Instructions for this exercise are available at <https://github.com/temple-geography/census-gis/blob/master/Shift-Share%20Analysis.md>.

You will complete this exercise in your term project research teams. Teams are 3-4 students. The exercise asks you to calculate employment growth or decline for a metro area. You may pick a metro area in one of your assigned states, but you will all do the same state. Each person will calculate the shift-share for a different time period. One person should do the entire period (1900 thru the most recent year available).

After each person has completed their time period discuss the results with your group. What sectors does your metro area show competitive advantage in? Has that changed over time? Was that sector hit particularly hard during a specific period that you analyzed?

## Deliverables

In your deliverables, please identify the metro area clearly, e.g. in the filename or in table headings, and definitely in your narrative discussion.

* The shift-share spreadsheet for **your** time period (each group member will do a different time period).
* A couple of paragraphs with your summary of and thoughts about the group discussion, either in the spreadsheet or as a separate PDF. Include your team members names.
