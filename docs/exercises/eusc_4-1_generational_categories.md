# Exercise: Generational Categories

Complete Ex. 4.1 in *Exploring the U.S. Census* using data from 2020 for your chosen state. The relevant table in the 2020 Decennial Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) has the same table code as in 2010, PCT12 SEX BY SINGLE-YEAR AGE. Download this table for your state from data.census.gov.

In data.census.gov, if you download a CSV (or Excel file) it will be in a *long* format (variables in rows). If you download the ZIP, it will be in a *wide* format (variables in columns). Usually we want a wide format. However, in this exercise, the first thing the textbook instructs you to do after opening the file is to *transpose* (or pivot) the data from wide to long. Therefore, for this exercise, you may choose to download the CSV rather than the ZIP and skip that first step.

Note that while the textbook uses the term Post-Millenials for the generation born after 1996, ["Generation Z" has become more common](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/). You may leave the end year as 2010, or choose a later year. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z#Date_and_age_range> for guidance.

Do not use the `ROUND` function. Do not multiply by 100 to generate percentages. Instead, use cell formatting to display numbers as a percentage and to limit the number of decimal places shown.

## Deliverables

Turn in your spreadsheet of the generational categories showing the count and percent of population in each generation for your state. Because we are omitting the generation after Gen Z, percentages will not sum to 100.
