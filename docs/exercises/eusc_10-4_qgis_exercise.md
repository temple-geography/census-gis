# QGIS Exercise

This exercise is an introduction to the open source, cross-platform GIS software QGIS (<qgis.org>). This is a lengthly exercise that fills the entirety of [Section 10.4 in *Exploring the U.S. Census*](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/mono/exploring-the-us-census/chpt/10-mapping-gis#text-section-4-0).

You will have a little extra time (1Â½ weeks) to complete this exercise. See Canvas for the exact due date.

**As this exercise is somewhat more complex, we will complete it using the textbook data. You do not have to download data for  your state, or for a more recent ACS year.** The textbook data is available at <https://study.sagepub.com/researchmethods/research-methods/donnelly-exploring-the-us-census>, and has also been uploaded to Canvas. The data for this exercise is in `Data Sets Batch2.zip`.

**Skip the "Geographic Analysis" subsection (pp. 338-342).** The buffer layer created in these instructions is not used in the final map layout anyway.

When completing your map layout, credit yourself as cartographer. You can place this under the source information.

## Deliverables

Submit a PDF of your final map. Make sure that your name appears on the map.

Please make sure to follow the instructions in "Map Layout" to create a layout and export the PDF from the layout window. Do not export the PDF from the main application window. (**HINT:** If the leftmost menu says Project, you are in the main application window. If the leftmost menu says Layout, you are in the layout window.)
