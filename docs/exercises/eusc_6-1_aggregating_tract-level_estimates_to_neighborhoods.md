# Exercise: Aggregating Tract-Level Estimates to Neighborhoods

Complete Ext 6.1 in *Exploring the U.S. Census* using data from 2023 for a neighborhood in a major city in your state. In a previous exercise, you identified the largest county in your state. The largest county is probably host to the largest city, or another major city in your state. You can pick any neighborhood that is comprised of at least three Census tracts. (If you find that no neighborhoods in your city satisfy this requirement, please show me your data so we can discuss what neighborhood you should work with.)

You will begin by identifying the tracts that approximate the chosen neigbhorhood. It will be easiest to explore the tracts and neighborhoods in QGIS. Neighborhoods are usually defined by social consensus, and not official administrative units. In class I will demonstrate how to do this for the textbook example of the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood in Cincinatti using data downloaded from the [Cincinatti Open Data Portal](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/), which I found by searching Google for "cincinatti open data". Before class, you might try to find a similar portal for your city, and download neighborhood boundaries and Census tracts. Note that while we usually download tracts directly from the Census servers, many open data portals will already have tracts extracted for their city or state. If you find you have trouble finding neighborhood boundaries for your city, I will help you search during class time.

Begin by downloading the data for table `B07204` for your city and the tracts that make up your neighborhood from [https:\\data.census.gov](data.census.gov). Note that you *can* select geographies from different summary levels, so it is possible to download your city (search the Place geography) and your neighborhood's Census tracts in a single table.
