# Assignments & Grading

This course will make use of a variant of [Specification Grading](https://sites.temple.edu/hachadoorian/specification-grading/). This means that many assignments will be graded Complete/Incomplete or assigned a provisional grade, and in some cases will merely be returned with comments. Assignments marked Incomplete or not awarded full points may be revised and resubmitted. Quizzes can be retaken until passed, unless otherwise specified.

You will earn points along several **tracks**. Each track is worth up to 100 points. You must progress along ***ALL*** tracks to be successful in this course. Your final grade is based on the ***lowest*** score earned along any track.

Tracks proceed linearly and assignments usually need to be completed in the designated order. For example, for quizzes, the material is cumulative, and you can't earn credit for Quiz 4 if you haven't passed Quiz 3. Often, later assignments in a track presume knowledge you will have acquired by completing earlier assignments.

Some assignments proceed in milestones. In each case, you must proceed along the milestones in order. For example, for a term project, there will often be an initial topic statement, followed by an annotated bibliography (for a paper) or analysis plan (for an analytical project), a draft, and a final report. You cannot submit an annotated bibliography if your topic statement has not been approved, and you cannot submit a draft or final report if you haven't submitted an annotated bibliography or analysis plan.

Grading will conform to the following scale:

* A 93%+
* A- 90 - <93%
* B+ 87 - <90%
* B 83 - <87%
* B- 80 - <83%
* C+ 77 - <80%
* C 73 - <77%
* C- 70 - <73%
* D+ 67 - <70%
* D 63 - <67%
* D- 60 - <63%
* F <60%

## Attendance

0-100 points. Your attendance score is a straight percentage of class session you are present for.

This course meets once a week. Missing *any* class meetings will hamper your ability to complete the work in this course. High-performing students tend to be the ones who attend all class meetings. Struggling students may be struggling for a variety of reasons, but for many of them, lack of attendance is a contributing factor. Your attendance percentage will also indicate the maximum final grade you can earn in this course. If you miss 3 classes, you have attended 78.6% of class meetings. Accordingly, your final grade will not be higher than a C+, *regardless of any other work completed*.

An exception is that missing one class (attending 92.9% of class meetings) will still earn an A in the Attendance Track.
