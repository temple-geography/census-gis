# Schedule in Detail

*EUSC* refers to *Exploring the U.S. Census* by Donnelly. Links below are designed to work on campus. You will have to use the library proxy server to access them off campus.

*AUSCD* refers to [*Analyzing U.S. Census Data*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) by Walker. This is an open textbook. Links below will work from anywhere.

[Learning the R Tidyverse](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-r-tidyverse-24332729) is a LinkedIn Learning course that you have access to through Temple. I find that I have to log into LinkedIn Learning through TUportal first, then go to the course link, rather than trying to log in at the LinkedIn Learning website.
