# Overview

## Purpose of the Course

A wide variety of social and environmental phenomena, including crime, urban development, pollution, and commuting, are influenced by or affect people where they live and work. Data gathered by the United States Census Bureau are used across a wide variety of fields for everything from market research to public health research. The purpose of this course is to:

* Provide significant exposure to and experience with the Decennial Census and American Community Survey
* Familiarize the student with a selection of other government data products, such as the Economic Census, Census of Governments, or American Housing Survey
* Teach a selection of widely used methods for analyzing Census data and combining Census data with other data sources
* Teach how to work with Census data products in an automated and reproducible fashion

## Prerequisites

There are no course prerequisites; however, a working knowledge of Windows and basic file management is expected.

## Software

This course will make heavy use of free and open source software. All software will be installed on lab computers. Since the software is free, students may also install all software on their own computers or laptops. If you have a laptop that you can bring to class, you may prefer to work on your own laptop, so that you don’t have to shuffle data between lab computers and flash drives. Also, if you prefer working on Mac, the software we use for this course is cross-platform and can be installed on Mac.

* [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/)
    * Alternatively, you can use Google Sheets
    * Alternatively, you can use Excel; Temple students have free access to Microsoft 365: <https://education.temple.edu/help/microsoft>
